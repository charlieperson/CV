## Experience

#### Lead Developer at English Tutors Live
###### Lisbon, Portugal &emsp; February 2016 - Present
- Our mission is to give anyone who wants to learn a language, their own personal teacher.
- Decided that single table inheritance was not as scalable as separating out the two user models (student and teacher), which established a flexible foundation, allowing the implementation of future features to be carried out without modification.
- Built platform architecture that enables students to find a teacher that suits them, and enhance learning by allowing teachers to give students notes and homework upon completion of each class.

#### Growth Hacker at Person & Partners Automotive Advertising
###### Austin, Texas &emsp; December 2013 - June 2014
- Member of the lead generation team.
- Observed the effect that altering different elements on landing pages had on analytics, adjusted accordingly, and brought the bounce rate down from 48% to 37% over six months for Greenway Dodge.
- Decreased average lead cost from $3.47 to $2.68 for Greenway Dodge by experimenting with various search engine optimization, conversion rate optimization, A/B testing, and Google Analytics strategies.

## Education

#### [Maker’s Academy]
###### London, England &emsp; October 2015 - March 2016
A sixteen week highly selective web development bootcamp. The curriculum consists of Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and whatever else is needed to get the job done. We were taught best practices from the beginning. We learned the importance of always test driving development, keeping code DRY, pair programming, the escalation process, and the single responsibility principle. This is where I fell in love with code.

#### [Hyper Island Digital Media Creative]
###### Stockholm, Sweden &emsp; August 2014 - June 2016
A digital media school focused on group dynamics, and how to best utilize talent among team members. Digital Media Creative is a two year immersive learning journey exploring topics from design to technology, and strategy to project management. I got the privilege to present to companies like IKEA and Hugo Boss. This school is where I found myself.
