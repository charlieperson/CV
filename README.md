## Charlie Person

I’m an enthusiastic web developer that works and plays well with others. I appreciate well calculated risks, failing fast, and trying to learn from everything I do.

## Skills

#### Curious, dedicated, and responsible

- Presenting, public speaking, and pitching make life worth living for me. Practice makes perfect, and I never turn down an opportunity to refine these skills.
- I am persistent when facing adversity. I do not allow myself to struggle on a problem more than 20 minutes before looking elsewhere for a solution.
- I give and receive feedback in a professional environment constructively.
- I'm a receptive listener and an effective communicator.
- I always strive for best practices and simplicity with code. I always consider if other developers will be able to extend my code without resorting to modification.
- I don't pretend to know things.

A sixteen week highly selective web development bootcamp. The curriculum consists of Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and whatever else needed to get the job done.
