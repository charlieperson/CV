## Charlie Person

I’m an enthusiastic web developer that works and plays well with others. At seventeen, I moved to Sweden directly after completing secondary school to study tech, and group dynamics at Hyper Island, and then went on to further my knowledge of code at Makers Academy in London. I appreciate well calculated risks, failing fast, and trying to learn from everything I do.

## Skills

#### Curious, dedicated, and responsible

- Presenting, public speaking, and pitching make life worth living for me. Practice makes perfect, and I never turn down an opportunity to refine these skills.
- I am persistent when facing adversity. I do not allow myself to struggle on a problem more than 20 minutes before looking elsewhere for a solution. At Maker's Academy, we call this the escalation process.
- Feedback. I attended a Digital Media school called Hyper Island based in Stockholm Sweden. I was trained how to give and receive feedback in a professional environment constructively.
- I'm a receptive listener and an effective communicator.
- I don't pretend to know things.

#### Clean code

Makers Academy has equipped me with a working knowledge of the very best practices in modern software development.

- Software development is a team effort. I am a huge advocate of pair programming. Makers Academy fully embraces as evidenced by the fact that throughout the course we were asked to pair with someone different every day. This helped me further develop strong teamworking and interpersonal skills in the context of coding.
- At Makers, I learned that development should be seen as a craft. Using the red, green, refactor model, working code is just the first step, refactoring for simplicity and to allow other developers to understand and extend my code without resorting to modification is crucial.
- I have a great curiosity and passion for technology. I enjoy independent and exploratory learning as well as experimenting with new ideas and technologies as they arise in order to expand my skill set.

## Experience

#### Ruby on Rails Developer at English Tutors Live — Lisbon, Portugal (February 2016 - PRESENT)
English Tutors Live connects students that want to learn English, with tutors that can teach them over Skype. A commission is taken from each class. While the business model works, the current structure requires too much manual work. We’re currently building out a platform in Ruby on Rails to automate the service. This is what gets me out of bed.

### Digital Intern, Person & Partners Automotive Advertising — Austin, Texas (December 2013 - June 2014)
I interned under Jason Steele’s lead generation team with a focus on search engine optimization, conversion rate optimization, display, A/B testing, Google Analytics and various strategies to lower an average cost per phone and form lead. Obtained AdWords certification.

## Education

### Maker’s Academy — London, England (October 2015 - March 2016)
A sixteen week highly selective web development bootcamp. The curriculum consists of Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and whatever else needed to get the job done. We were taught best practices from the beginning. We learned the importance of always test driving development, keeping code DRY, pair programming, the escalation process, and the single responsibility principle. This is where I fell in love with code. http://www.makersacademy.com/
